            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> 
                After receiving my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Virginia (link to CE department at UVa)
                and a master's degree in civil engineering from Texas A&M University (INSERT LINK),
                I worked for four years as a traffic engineer for Vollmer Associates in Boston, Massachusetts (later acquired by Stantec).
            </p>
            <p>
                I then attended Duke University School of Law and spent my first two years in a commercial litigation practice
                at Testa, Hurwitz & Thibault in Boston, Massachusetts.  Deciding that I was not interested in practicing litigation,
                I moved to Seattle and received my LLM in Taxation from the Unvirsity of Washington and then spent nearly 15 years
                practicing tax law at Perkins Coie.  In September 2018, I chose to homeschool my then 3rd and 6th graders and left the
                regular practice of law.  I am currently continuing to homeschool my now 7th grader.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since I left the regular practice of law and when not teaching my children, I have been learning and relearning.
            </p>
