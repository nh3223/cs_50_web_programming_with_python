            <p> 
                I have had a multi-faceted career with an underlying theme of learning new things and challenging myself.  
                I started my career as a traffic engineer for Vollmer Associates (later acquired by 
                <a href="https://www.stantec.com/en" target="_blank">Stantec</a>)
                in Boston, Massachusetts after receiving a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from the 
                <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/engineering-systems-and-environment">University of Virginia</a> 
                and a Master's degree in Civil Engineering from 
                <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/civil/index.html">Texas A&M University</a> 
                where I also worked as a research assistant affiliated with the 
                <a href="https://tti.tamu.edu/">Texas Transportation Institute</a>.
                While at Vollmer, I worked on a variety of traffic design and modeling projects,
                with the most amount of time spent working on ground transportation issues at
                <a href="http://www.massport.com/logan-airport/to-from-logan/transportation-options/ground-transportation/">Logan Airport</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                After four years at Vollmer, I switched gears and attended the 
                <a href="https://law.duke.edu/">Duke University School of Law</a> 
                from which I received my J.D. in 2000.  After graduation, I practiced for two years as a commercial litigator at 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testa,_Hurwitz_%26_Thibeault">Testa, Hurwitz & Thibault</a> 
                in Boston, Massachusetts.  Deciding that I was more interested in practicing tax law, I moved to Seattle 
                and received my LLM in Taxation from the 
                <a href="https://www.law.uw.edu/academics/llm/tax">Unvirsity of Washington</a>, 
                after which I spent nearly 15 years practicing tax law at
                <a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/">Perkins Coie</a> 
                in Seattle.  My practice at Perkins was a general federal income tax practice, with a primary focus on
                mergers & acquisitions, limited liability companies and public shipping companies.
            </p>
            <p>  
                In September 2018, I left the regular practice of law to homeschool my then 3rd and 6th graders. 
                Our homeschool year gave us the amazing opportunity to take family trips to Thailand and Cambodia,
                as well as Spain and Portugal.  I am currently continuing to homeschool my now 7th grader while teaching
                myself programming and data science as I change directions to continue learning and challenging myself.
