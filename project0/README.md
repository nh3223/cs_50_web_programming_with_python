# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project is a rough first draft of a personal website that will document my computer and data science learning journey and hopefully showcase a portfolio of web design and data science projects.  The current version is certainly not a polished design, but satisfies the standards set forth in the Project description.  The intent is that this site will be updated as I continue to go through the course to encompass features as I learn them further.
